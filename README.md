# JavaScript Test

## Complete all questions to the best of your abilities. You can use google, but you cannot ask other students or teachers for help. Also, do not copy code.

1. Write a program to display the city name if the string begins with "Los" or "New" otherwise return "The city name does not begin with Los or New".

2. Write a program to calculate the sum of three elements of a given array of integers. The length of the array must be 3.  
   Example
   [5, 10, 15] ➞ 30

3. Given two strings, firstName and lastName, return a single string in the format "last, first".
   Examples
   "John", "Doe" ➞ "Doe, John"
   "Mary", "Green" ➞ "Green, Mary"

4. Write a program that checks whether or not an integer is divisible by 100.
   Examples & Expected Output
   1 ➞ false
   1000 ➞ true
   100 ➞ true

5. Write a program that adds a string ending to each member in an array.
   Examples & Expected output
   ["clever", "meek", "hurried", "nice"], "ly"
   ➞ ["cleverly", "meekly", "hurriedly", "nicely"]

["new", "pander", "scoop"], "er"
➞ ["newer", "panderer", "scooper"]

["bend", "sharpen", "mean"], "ing"
➞ ["bending", "sharpening", "meaning"]

6. Write a program that checks whether a number is even or odd and returns "even" for even numbers and "odd" for odd numbers.
   Examples & Expected Output
   3 ➞ "3 is odd"
   146 ➞ "146 is even"
   19 ➞ "19 is odd"

7. Make a variable with the string value of "maria jane jones". Convert each first letter to uppercase. Make sure your code works for any three names e.g. "john james smith".

8. You are given 2 out of 3 of the angles in a triangle in degrees. Write a program that classifies a missing angle of a triangle as either "acute", "right", or "obtuse" based on its degrees.

An acute angle is one smaller than 90 degrees.
A right angle is one that is exactly 90 degrees.
An obtuse angle is one greater than 90 degrees (but smaller than 180 degrees).
For example: 11, 20 should return "obtuse", since the missing angle would be 149 degrees, which makes it obtuse.

Examples
27, 59 (29 + 59 = 88), (180 - 88 = 92) ➞ Then the third angle is 92degrees so it is "obtuse"
135, 11 ➞ The third angle is "acute"
45, 45 ➞ The third angle is a "right angle"

9. Write a program that takes a string and returns the word count. The string should be a sentence.
   Examples & Expected output
   "This is an example" ➞ 4
   "One more example for good measure" ➞ 6
   "JavaScript is fun, right?" ➞ 4

10. Write a program to multiply each value in an array by the length of the array. Return the result as shown in the examples.
    Examples
    [2, 3, 1, 0] (2 _ 4), (3 _ 4), (1 _ 4), (0 _ 4) ➞ [8, 12, 4, 0][4, 1, 1] ➞ [12, 3, 3][1, 0, 3, 3, 7, 2, 1] ➞ [7, 0, 21, 21, 49, 14, 7][0] ➞ [0]
